*NOTE: This software is designed for, but, not
       is a GNU software yet.

This is GNU FC2D, a two temporal dimensional(2D time)
programing language( C like ). This program was made on
GNU/Linux. A machine with GNU/Linux installed, GNU 
development tools (gcc, make, etc.) and GLib should
be sufficient to compile and run it. If you found any
BUG, report to Actual GNU FC2D Maintainer. 

Dependencies
============

* GLib <http://www.gtk.org/download/>
* GLib thread <http://www.gtk.org/download/>
* "AC_HEADER_TIME"

Installation
============

You can install using one of three ways,
read INSTALL for more details:

./configure && make && sudo make install
(or)
sh ./configure && make && sudo make install
(or)
./configure --prefix=/usr/ && make && sudo make install

Running
=======
Once the GNU FC2D is installed you can run one
of the sample programs (see the examples directory)
Go to the examples directory and run fc2d:
cd examples
fc2d hello-word.fc2d

Getting help
============
For some people this topic can be difficult, so if
you have any difficulty ask to Fabio J. Gonzalez,
but, before see software documentation in doc
directory.

After install you can see the documentation,
with the command:
    info fc2d
    
but, I suggest you make a PDF(per example) and see
in some graphical interface( images can help you
understand better ).
Exists more option to see images, per example, 
making a DVI or HTML.

To create a PDF use the command:
    make pdf
To create a DVI:
    make pdf
To create a HTML:
    make html

In the top build directory
