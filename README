Introduction
=========================
FGameEngine is a free library, developed for fun,
which is distributed under the GNU GPL license.
Its original focus is the creation of games, but
covers many other utilities, for example creating
3D simulations, that can be interactive or not.
FGameEngine, allows the creation of non-graphic
applications too. FGameEngine was licensed with
a strong copyleft, and read COPYING LICENSE
for more information.

About it`s versions
=========================
Older versions of FGameEngine can still be downloaded.
The recent versions of FGameEngine, has a different
focus of the former. FGameEngine began as a library
for use together with CrystalSpace. From version 
0.1, this changed, recent versions of FGameEngine,
are not intended to be used along with CrystalSpace.
In terms of source code source, are very different
versions. Recent versions of FGameEngine, try supply
the characteristics of the older versions (before 0.1)
with improvements, but are very different things.
