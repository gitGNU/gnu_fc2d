@top General Introduction
The complete engine for 3D games and more.
The main focus of FGameEngine is GNU/Linux
but may work on other systems (who knows?).
This manual will introduce you, FGameEngine.
It will teach you how to create games,
reading/writing songs and videos, using
the event system, and how to create 
graphical user interfaces, etc.

@node What is FGameEngine?
@section What is FGameEngine?

FGameEngine is a library for easy creation
of various types of programs, such as video
editors, games, etc. FGameEngine is an
abstraction layer for some libraries, too.

@node What do FGameEngine?
@section What do FGameEngine?

FGameEngine is planned to allow you
simply and quickly to:
@table @code
@item Media
Load and write media( eg AVI, MPEG, OGG Vorbis, MP3 ).

@item Its own graphical interface
Draw on the screen fields with values animation support 
(As the Blender(enter the frame typing @kbd{@key{I}}))
for graphical interaction with the User.

@item Its own event system
Make programs that respond to events, add many functions
to the same event. The abstraction layer FGameEngine 
provides support to various types of events 
(or fEvents, if you prefer).

@item Its own thread system
You can make lines of threads in synchronism. You can make
lines of threads to run simultaneously and one after 
another, including mixing any lines. A function called outside
threads(fThreads system) system can enter the system using a
existent 'fThread' and exit the system quickly.

@item Its own sound system
FGameEngine becomes playing sounds in the 'background',
using the threads system (or fthreads). Samples are
automatically placed in the play line and played.
All this is trying to stop you work as little as
possible.
